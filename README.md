 ## all above libraries must be installed before executing this code.
 ## OPEN TERMINAL -> TYPE pip install Library_name to install libraries on machine and keep both .ipynb and .json file in same folder.
 ## I have implemented a python code which work like chatbot it takes input and gives output in voice format. I have implemented this by building nueral network 
 ## basically this comes under domain of NLP(Natural Language Processing) . After taking input it perform tokenisation and lemmatization on corpus and feed 
 ## cleaned corpus to nueral network. It is a retrieval based chatbot that works on given dataset (intent) and gives responses to user based 
 ## on their queries(data given by user). Basically it is a keyword matching model which try to generate link between user data with given      dataset(intent.json).
